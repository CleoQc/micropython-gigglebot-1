v0.2.0:
  title: GiggleBot MicroPython Firmware v0.2.0
  body:
    - Add sphinx documentation for readthedocs.org which includes some tutorials, the API description
      of the `gigglebot.py`/`gigglebot_advanced.py`/`distance_sensor.py` modules.
    - Add less complex module called the `gigglebot.py` and rename the old one to `gigglebot_advanced.py`.
    - Optimize `gigglebot.py` module for the microbit board to use less RAM.
    - Fix formatting and semantic issues in the documentation.
    - Fix syntax and logic problems in `gigglebot_advanced.py` module (which is the old module called `gigglebot.py`).
    - Minify python modules before integrating them into the firmware.
v0.1.0:
  title: GiggleBot MicroPython Firmware v0.1.0
  body:
    - Came up with the solution to integrate python modules directly within the firmware of the microbit.
      More details can be seen here https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython/issues/555.
    - Enabled the import of frozen modules, pre-compiled python modules and `memoryview` class.
    - Automated the building instructions of the micropython firmware for the gigglebot/microbit. Used docker
      to simply it even more and to allow for building it on Windows machines.
    - Reduced the number of recursions to a minimum with the distance sensor library 
      and made it not use much RAM memory when imported.
    - Added the gigglebot library to this release.
    - Added build server (with Travis-CI) and automated the release of new versions.
