  title: GiggleBot MicroPython Firmware v0.2.0
  body:
    - Add sphinx documentation for readthedocs.org which includes some tutorials and the API description
      of the gigglebot.py module.
    - Add less complex module called the gigglebot.py.
    - Optimize gigglebot.py module for the microbit board to use less RAM.

v0.1.0:
  title: GiggleBot MicroPython Firmware v0.1.0
  body:
    - Came up with the solution to integrate python modules directly within the firmware of the microbit.
      More details can be seen here https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython/issues/555.
    - Enabled the import of frozen modules, pre-compiled python modules and `memoryview` class.
    - Automated the building instructions of the micropython firmware for the gigglebot/microbit. Used docker
      to simply it even more and to allow for building it on Windows machines.
    - Reduced the number of recursions to a minimum with the distance sensor library 
      and made it not use much RAM memory when imported.
    - Added the gigglebot library to this release.
    - Added build server (with Travis-CI) and automated the release of new versions.
